# Advent of Code
My solutions/attempts for Advent of Code.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

For 2021, I am attempting to solve them in Python and Rust (and SQL?! although I have put those few random solutions on gists)
